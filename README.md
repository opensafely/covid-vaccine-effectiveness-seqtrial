## project.yaml
The [`project.yaml`](./project.yaml) defines run-order and dependencies for all the analysis scripts. 
It is split into a series of "actions", each one implementing a step in the analysis pipeline.
The file is annotated to describe the purpose of each action. 
This file is where you should start if you wish to understand the analysis pipeline.

**The [`project.yaml`](./project.yaml) should *not* be edited directly**. To make changes, edit and run the [`create-project.R`](./create-project.R) script instead.
There is no need to run [`create_project.R`](./create_project.R) if you are simply cloning this repo.
